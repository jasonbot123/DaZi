## **Project Summary**
Dazi is a **community-centric app** designed exclusively for students at the **University of Toronto (U of T)**. Its purpose is to simplify and enhance social interactions and collaborations by providing a unique platform for connecting like-minded peers. With Dazi, students can efficiently find partners for various activities—academic, social, or recreational.

### **Motivation**
University life is bustling yet often isolating. Traditional methods of seeking connections—such as emails, bulletin boards, or social media groups—are either inefficient or too broad.

3. **Streamlined Communication**: Built-in tools like messaging and profile viewing enable seamless interactions.
4. **Activity Visibility**: Showcase initiatives to attract participants effortlessly.

### **How Does Dazi Work?**
1. **Create Posts**: Organize activities or request help with tasks (e.g., recruiting teammates, survey participants, or social events).
2. **Browse and Join**: Explore activities and join those matching your interests or goals.
3. **Connect and Collaborate**: Message and view profiles of participants for a trusted, seamless connection.

### **Who Benefits from Dazi?**
- **Students Seeking Collaboration**: Effortlessly find group members or participants.
