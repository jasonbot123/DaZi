## **Project Summary**
Dazi is a **community-centric app** designed exclusively for students at the **University of Toronto (U of T)**. Its purpose is to simplify and enhance social interactions and collaborations by providing a unique platform for connecting like-minded peers. With Dazi, students can efficiently find partners for various activities—academic, social, or recreational.

### **Motivation**
University life is bustling yet often isolating. Traditional methods of seeking connections—such as emails, bulletin boards, or social media groups—are either inefficient or too broad.  
Dazi bridges this gap by fostering a **safe, trusted environment** exclusive to U of T students, ensuring genuine community connections.

### **What Problem Does Dazi Solve?**
1. **Efficient Networking**: Easily find and connect with peers for specific activities.
2. **Verified Community**: U of T-exclusive accounts via university email verification.
3. **Streamlined Communication**: Built-in tools like messaging and profile viewing enable seamless interactions.
4. **Activity Visibility**: Showcase initiatives to attract participants effortlessly.

### **How Does Dazi Work?**
1. **Create Posts**: Organize activities or request help with tasks (e.g., recruiting teammates, survey participants, or social events).
2. **Browse and Join**: Explore activities and join those matching your interests or goals.
3. **Connect and Collaborate**: Message and view profiles of participants for a trusted, seamless connection.

### **Who Benefits from Dazi?**
- **Students Seeking Collaboration**: Effortlessly find group members or participants.
- **Event Organizersb  **: Target U of T-specific audiences for academic or social events.
- **Socially Active Students**: Discover opportunities to connect, socialize, and build relationships.
